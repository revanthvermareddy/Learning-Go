### 6 Main Points about Go:

### 1.) Statically Typed Language

Ex:

```go
// declare vairable type explicitly
var myVariable string

// (or)

// infer automatically
var myVariable = "myString"
```

### 2.) Strongly Typed Language

Ex:

```go
// operation that can be performated on a variable depends on its type

a = 1
b = "two"

// can't add an int and string together
c = a + b // (this is not allowed)
```

### 3.) Go is compiled

i.e, Go comes with a compiler, that translates code into machine code, producing a bianry file which can be run as a standalone program.

### 4.) Fast Compile Time

### 5.) Built In Concurrency

### 6.) Simplicity
